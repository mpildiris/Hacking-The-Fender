Solution of Hacking The Fender (CodeAcademy -> Projects)

#
The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and public enemy, has gained access to several highly confidential passwords, including yours. Your mission involves three critical tasks. First, you need to penetrate The Fender's systems. Next, you must modify his "passwords.txt" file to encrypt the sensitive information. Finally, you need to append the signature of Slash Null, another hacker whose malicious activities could be prevented by The Fender if he perceives Slash Null as a rival.

Utilize your expertise in Python file handling to extract, modify, obscure, and generate data as you embark on this mission for justice. Engage with CSV files and other text formats in this demonstration of Python's powerful file manipulation capabilities.
